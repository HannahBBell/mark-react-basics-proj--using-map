This project is all about comparing a TS programme to a JS programme, using [previous work on FizzBuzz in JavaScript as inspiration](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--js-fizzbuzz).

## Learning Outcomes

- Annotate the type of a function's parameter(s)
- Annotate the return type of a function

## Exercise 0: Cloning, inspecting code and running tests

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** you have all tests passing on your local machine

Whilst this may not be explicitly spelled out in future projects, this is a pretty good way to begin orienting yourself in an unknown codebase.

```bash
cd ~/Academy/Mark
git clone https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--ts-fizzbuzz
cd mark-fundamentals-proj--ts-fizzbuzz
yarn # install dependencies
yarn test # run tests
```

## Exercise 1: Understanding the extra TypeScript parts

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** you can explain all the additional TypeScript syntax in `fizzbuzz.ts` (relative to its JavaScript equivalent)

Have a look at the code in `src/fizzbuzz.ts`. You'll see it looks _pretty similar_ to code that you've seen before in our JavaScript fizzbuzz solution, just with some extra parts.

We'll try to understand this by looking at a few examples (not from this codebase).

### Annotating function parameters

Consider the below function:

```js
function findLowestCommonMultiple(numOne, numTwo) {
  // details omitted - unimportant
  ...
  return lowestCommonMultiple // assume we declared and found this above
}
```

It looks like this function is intended to find and return the [lowest common multiple](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z9hb97h/revision/5) of two numbers, for example:

```js
// some cases we might test
findLowestCommonMultiple(3, 5); // => 15
findLowestCommonMultiple(3, 6); // => 6
findLowestCommonMultiple(6, 15); // => 30
```

but what should our function return in the following cases?

```js
// some, uh, weird cases
findLowestCommonMultiple(true, 12); // => ???
findLowestCommonMultiple("me", "you", "blue"); // => ???
findLowestCommonMultiple({ firstName: "Richard", lastName: "Ng" }); // => ???
```

These would all be _really silly things_ to run. It simply doesn't make sense to ask for the lowest common multiple of `"me"`, `"you"` and `"blue"`.

But... JavaScript will let you run this.

There's an example you can check out in `src/examples/lcm.js`, and run with `yarn start:lcm:js` (check out `package.json` scripts for details).

If you run it, you'll actually get trapped in an infinite `while` loop - exit out of this with `Ctrl + C` in your terminal where it's running.

On the other hand, consider the below TypeScript type annotations:

```ts
function findLowestCommonMultiple(numOne: number, numTwo: number) {
  // details omitted - unimportant
  ...
  return lowestCommonMultiple // assume we declared and found this above
}
```

This adds in some type restrictions: both `numOne` and `numTwo` need to be numbers - and TypeScript won't let us compile it (and therefore blocks us from running it) if we pass in different types.

```ts
findLowestCommonMultiple(true, 12); // Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

You can check out this example at `src/examples/lcm.ts`, and run it with `yarn start:lcm:ts` (again, see `package.json` for details).

**Try un-commenting the silly examples** - you'll see (in VS Code) that TypeScript errors get underlined, and that we're blocked from running `yarn start:lcm:ts` (which is saving us from silly output).

We suggest you play around with the code and try to test the TypeScript compiler / error checker. (You'll notice that a single line can have multiple problems with it - both the number of arguments, as well as their types - which all need fixing before the line is permissible.)

### Annotating return types

Consider the below function:

```js
function getRandomBoolean() {
  // details omitted - unimportant
  ...
  return randomBoolean // assume we declared and found this above
}
```

It seems pretty clear that this function should return a (random) boolean value - either `true` or `false`.

However, JavaScript lets us do something silly like the following:

```js
function randomBoolean() {
  const randomNumber = Math.random();
  if (randomNumber < 0.5) {
    return false;
  } else {
    return "true";
  }
}
```

which returns the boolean `false` 50% of the time... and the _string_ `"true"` the rest of the time.

There's another example you can play around with using `yarn start:bool:js` - run it a few times to see both return values.

Returning the string `"true"` instead of the boolean `true` is the sort of careless mistake we would like to be able to avoid (remember the TypeScript design goal: ["Statically identify constructs that are likely to be errors."](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals)).

So, in TypeScript, we can annotate the intended return type of a function:

```ts
function randomBoolean(): boolean {
  const randomNumber = Math.random();
  if (randomNumber < 0.5) {
    return false;
  } else {
    return "true"; // <-- TS now catches this error!
  }
}
```

There's another demo to inspect at `src/examples/bool.ts`, which you can run with `yarn start:bool:ts`.

### Combining the two

Consider the following example:

```ts
function findLongestString(arrOfStrings: string[]): string {
  // details omitted as usual
  ...
  return longestString;
}
```

This says:

- This function receives one argument that must be an array of strings
- This function must return a string

So TypeScript will stop you from doing the following careless mistakes:

- accidentally passing in a single string rather than an array of strings
- accidentally returning the longest string's length (i.e. a number) instead of the string itself

There's an example (`src/examples/longest-string` in `.js` and `.ts`) for you to play around with and experiment with as usual.

###Â What types can you use?

We've seen a few different types in the above examples: `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `string[]` (array of strings).

The TypeScript handbook has a good section on [Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html), which you should review.

The important ones are: Boolean, Number, String, Array, Tuple, Any, Void, Null and Undefined.

These can additionally be joined with [Union types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html), for example:

- `boolean | string`: either `boolean` or `string`
- `string | string[]`: either `string` or `string[]`
- `(number | boolean)[]` an array which contains elements that are all either `number` or `boolean`

There is much more that you can do with types - but that's enough for now...!

### Interpreting TypeScript FizzBuzz

If you understand all of the above, you should be able to understand the code in `src/fizzbuzz.ts`.

We strongly suggest that you spend some significant time doing the following:

- **plan** a change to the code
- **predict** would happen if you made that change
- **change** the code
- **observe** the result
- **update** your mental model based on the result

The immediate feedback you get from TypeScript through this process will make this a relatively quick way of building up your understanding of (basic) TypeScript.

> ðŸ§  **Make your brain work.** The _predict_ step is very important. It's how you surface and test your mental model.

Here are some example things you could investigate:

- What happens if you change `toFizzbuzz`'s return type to `string` without changing the function body?
- What happens if you try pushing a random boolean value into `sequence` array in `fizzbuzz`?
- What happens if you remove the `return` statement from `isFizzbuzz`?
