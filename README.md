This project is all about comparing a TS programme to a JS programme, using [previous work on FizzBuzz in JavaScript as inspiration](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--js-fizzbuzz).

## Learning Outcomes

- Pass a function expression into map
- Pass an arrow function into map
- Pass an anonymous arrow function into map
- Use map of signature `T[] -> T[]`, e.g. `string[] -> string[]`
- Use map of signature `T[] -> U[]`, e.g. `string[] -> number[]`
- Use map to transform objects
- Use map to return JSX

Rough exercise ordering:

1. Read through `0-examples`
2. Complete `0-exercises` with function expressions passed in
3. Refactor `0-exercises` with arrow functions passed in
4. Refactor `0-exercises` with inline anonymous arrow functions
5. Refactor `0-exercises` with callbacks with type inferred

then more, WIP.
