This project is all about comparing a TS programme to a JS programme, using [previous work on FizzBuzz in JavaScript as inspiration](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--js-fizzbuzz).

## Learning Outcomes

- Pass a function expression into map
- Pass an arrow function into map
- Pass an anonymous arrow function into map
- Use map of signature `T[] -> T[]`, e.g. `string[] -> string[]`
- Use map of signature `T[] -> U[]`, e.g. `string[] -> number[]`
- Use map to transform objects
- Use map to return JSX

## Exercise 0a: Vanilla `.map` with function expressions

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criteria:** Tests passing for all the exercises in `src/vanilla/0-exercises`, using helper function expressions

The folder `src/vanilla/0-examples` has a few examples of `.map` (both tests and passing code, which you should review together).

MDN also has good [examples of the `.map` method on arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map#examples).

Use these to help you to write the code needed to pass the tests in `src/vanilla/0-exercises`, _in the same style as the examples_, i.e.:

1. Defining a separate helper function using a function expression
2. Passing that function expression to the array's `.map` method

You can use [Jest's options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) to [pass through a matcher/'regex'](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#jest-regexfortestfiles) for specific files/folders of tests, for example:

- `yarn test double-numbers` will run all tests that match the `double-numbers` path (i.e. `src/vanilla/0-examples/0-double-numbers.test.ts`)
- `yarn test 0-exercises` will run all tests that match the `1-exercises` path (i.e. all `.test.ts` files which have the `src/vanilla/0-exercises` directory in their path)

## Exercise 0b: Vanilla `.map` with separate arrow functions

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criteria:** Tests passing for all the exercises in `src/vanilla/0-exercises`, using helper arrow functions

The examples in `src/vanilla/0-examples` have some commented out code with some arrow function equivalents to the function expressions:

```ts
function doubleNumber(n: number): number {
  return n * 2;
}

// const doubleNumber = (n: number): number => n * 2;
```

Comment out the function expressions and de-comment the arrow functions - the tests with `yarn test 0-examples` should all still pass. (Instead of passing in a function expression, they're passing in an arrow function.)

See if you can refactor the code in `0-exercises` to use the arrow function syntax.

## Exercise 0c: Vanilla `.map` with explicitly typed anonymous arrow functions

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criteria:** Tests passing for all the exercises in `src/vanilla/0-exercises`, using anonymous arrow functions

The examples in `src/vanilla/0-examples` have some commented out code which uses in-line arrow functions:

```ts
function doubleNumbers(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  return numbers.map(doubleNumber);
}

...

// function doubleNumbers(numbers: number[]): number[] {
//   return numbers.map((n: number) => n * 2);
//   // return numbers.map((n) => n * 2)
// }
```

Comment out the first function expressions and de-comment the latter ones.

There _should_ still be one line still commented out - when you de-comment the function expression above, you should get the following:

```ts
function doubleNumbers(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  return numbers.map((n: number) => n * 2);
  // return numbers.map((n) => n * 2)
}
```

The relevant tests should still all pass. (Instead of passing in a reference to an arrow function to `.map`, you're passing in an in-lin eanonymous arrow function.)

See if you can refactor the code in `0-exercises` to use this in-line arrow function expression syntax.

1. Read through `0-examples`
2. Complete `0-exercises` with function expressions passed in
3. Refactor `0-exercises` with arrow functions passed in
4. Refactor `0-exercises` with inline anonymous arrow functions
5. Refactor `0-exercises` with callbacks with type inferred

then more, WIP.
